# Purpose

this software is an implementation of the methods and concepts presented in 'getting things done' by David Allen

at the beginning this will simply be a command line repl, but it will eventualy feed an api that is run locally on your machine

my goal is to then make it into a mobile app that uses your local storage so that your data stays private on your own device
