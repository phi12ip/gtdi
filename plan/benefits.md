# Benefits of using the Getting Things Done methods presented by David Allen

Less of a reliance on your own mind
- to remember all of the things that you need to do professionally
- to complete things on time and going along in the proper order
- to remember all of the things you want to do personally 

This is achieved by
- having one place (in-box) where everything from ideas to taxes go and then are turned into actionable events that bring the project to completion
- keeping everything as actionable events in a list

ex. when something occurs to you like "I need to get car oil changed," while you are in the middle of the shower or a business meeting, you add it to the action list instead of just letting it slip back into your unconscious mind.  

I am currently using a command line tool to make the lists and keep track of projects/deadlines/contexts but I am building a more full featured browser based tool to replace it.
